# AI4ALL Skin-Cancer-Detecting-Machine-Learning-Model
This project aims to provide an accurate skin-cancer detecting model that can be utilized in places where traditional dermatologist appointments are not equally accessible to everyone. Trained a convolutional neural network using the HAM10000 dataset to classify cancer cells into seven categories: Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec); basal cell carcinoma (bcc); benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl); dermatofibroma (df); melanoma (mel); melanocytic nevi (nv); and vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).
